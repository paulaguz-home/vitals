I build the project using the Atom IDE and running a local Apache webserver with Xampp

Although the instructions stated to not use any javascript libraries, I opted to use the fontawesome library to include the icons.  I attempeted to download .svg files for the icons included in the project but, was unable to find any of them that were available for free.  I had originally planned to pull the .svg files directly of crate a custom icon library with icomoon 

I was unable to find an overall_rating value in the JSON file for the given providers.  It only seemed to be defined in the nearby_providers element.  With that I opted to write my own javascript to calculate the overall rating using the  rating_per_star element for the given provider

I was unable to find a free version of the green stars that matched the ones in the mockups exactly.  I used ones that were as close to them as I could find.

Under ratings and reviews, I was unable to find any comments within the JSON file so, I omitted this section.

I did not build out the search feature so the page has been built against the first element in the JSON file
